## How to try this out:

* Install DietPi on your Raspberry Pi and start the system
* Connect to the Internet and enable Onboard Wifi
* Enable automatic boot
* Set OpenSSH as default SSH server with ```dietpi-software``` (this is for roms transferring)
* Run the following script and follow the steps

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tavuntu/rucopie/main/setup.sh | bash -s
```

* Reboot, and it should be ready to go!
